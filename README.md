## This is a super simple plugin that implements staff chat into Minecraft.

# How it works
There are 2 ways you can access the staff chat (at the moment). You can either use the command /staffchat or, you can use the provided, configurable, staff chat character.

By default, this character is "# ". This means you can talk to staff chat with "# <message>", the other staff members will get back "Staffchat >> <senderName> >> <message>". For instance, if I (CrazyBanana) type in chat, "# Hey everyone!". Other staff members would see, "Staffchat >> CrazyBanana >> Hey everyone!".

You can also use the /staffchat command. What this will do is toggle your staff chat use. This means, you can type /staffchat once, and all your messages will be in staff chat. Once you type it again, you will switch back to normal chat.

# Commands
/staffchat (/sc): Allows you to toggle on and off staff chat
/staffchatreload (/scr, /screload): Reloads the plugin.
